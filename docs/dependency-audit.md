Packages removed due to a `[SLOP]` verdict: none.
Packages flagged as suspicious: `httpx2`.

## The httpx2 finding

slopcheck flags `httpx2` with "Suspiciously close to 'httpx'. Could be a typosquat." That signal is
expected for this name. Counter-evidence, verified directly against PyPI and GitHub:

- `mcp` 2.0.0 `requires_dist` contains `httpx2>=2.5.0`, so the dependency is genuinely pulled in by
  the official MCP SDK, not by our own code.
- `httpx2` is published with `author_email: Tom Christie <tom@tomchristie.com>` (the author of
  `httpx`), maintainer `Pydantic Services Inc. <engineering@pydantic.dev>`, homepage and source
  `github.com/pydantic/httpx2` (the real pydantic organisation, 914 stars, not a fork, first
  release 2026-05-11), classifier `Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable`.
- The official SDK release notes for v2.0.0b2 name the switch explicitly: "httpx is replaced by
  httpx2 (#2972) ... the next-generation httpx fork with SSE support built in".
- `encode/httpx` has been inactive since March 2026, which makes the successor story consistent.

**Consequence for this repository:** `httpx2` is legitimate but young. It stays a transitive
dependency of `mcp` and is never listed in `pyproject.toml`. Our own HTTP code uses `httpx`
(`>=0.28,<0.29`), because `respx` mocks `httpx` and not `httpx2`.

Secondary observation, no action needed in phase 1: `httpx2` verifies TLS against the operating
system trust store (via `truststore`) instead of `certifi`. That becomes relevant only when an
integration test talks to a self-signed Nextcloud certificate; the Docker test setup uses plain
HTTP.

## Promoting cryptography from transitive to direct (2026-08-16, plan 03-02)

Phase 3 stores a Nextcloud app password per authorization, encrypted at rest. The
encryption lives in `src/mcp_connector/oauth/crypto.py` and imports the package directly:

```python
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidTag
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
```

The policy of this file says a package we import directly is declared directly, so the
entry in `pyproject.toml` is `cryptography>=50,<51`.

**What the promotion changes and what it does not.** Nothing is installed by it. The
package was already resolved through `mcp` to `pyjwt[crypto]` and is pinned at 50.0.0 in
`uv.lock`; the diff of the lock is two lines, both of them declarations. What changes is
that the project now says out loud what it relies on, so a future upstream change in `mcp`
cannot remove our encryption without a resolution failure that names it.

**Verification.** `slopcheck` was not runnable in this environment: it shells out to `pip`
and there is no `pip` on the PATH of this uv setup (`uv tool run --from slopcheck slopcheck
install cryptography` ends in a `FileNotFoundError`). The check was therefore done by hand
against the PyPI JSON API and the installed distribution:

- project URLs point at `github.com/pyca/cryptography`, the Python Cryptographic Authority,
- 158 releases, current version 50.0.0 uploaded 2026-07-31,
- one of the twenty most downloaded packages on PyPI, and a dependency of `pyjwt[crypto]`,
  which the official MCP SDK itself pulls in,
- `uv run --no-sync python -c "import cryptography; print(cryptography.__version__)"`
  answers `50.0.0`, the version in the lock.

**Owner decision.** Approved by the repository owner on 2026-08-16 after the question was
put explicitly, together with the constraint that the lock step must not touch the virtual
environment. `uv lock` was used instead of `uv add`, which writes `uv.lock` only.

**Why an alternative was not taken.** Leaving the package transitive was the other option.
It would have meant that the encryption of every stored app password depends on a decision
in someone else's dependency list: the day `mcp` drops `pyjwt[crypto]`, the next clean
install of this project fails at import time, in production, with no warning in between.

**Finding:** `httpx2 v2.10.0` appears exclusively as a child of `mcp[cli] v2.0.0`. It is not a
top-level entry, which is the machine-checkable form of the policy above. The unit test
`tests/unit/test_project_layout.py` asserts that no direct dependency starts with `httpx2`.

## Supply chain controls in force

- `uv.lock` is committed; CI installs with `uv sync --frozen` (no silent resolution drift).
- The SDK pin is `mcp[cli]>=2.0,<3`. Documented fallback pin if v2 turns out to be a blocker:
  `mcp>=1.29,<2` (1.x is in maintenance mode, security fixes only).
- No `npx --yes` and no auto-substitution of packages: a failing install is a human checkpoint,
  never a "try a similar name" retry.
- Re-run the audit whenever a direct dependency is added or a major version bumps.

## Upgrade check at phase 1 closing (T-01-SC, plan 14)

Executed on 2026-08-15 as required by the plan 14 threat register:

```
$ uv lock --upgrade-package mcp --dry-run
Resolved 60 packages in 591ms
No lockfile changes detected
```

Result: `mcp` 2.0.0 is current, no pending upstream release, the lockfile stays frozen.
The check is repeated at every phase closing; the lockfile is tracked and CI installs
with `uv sync --frozen`, so any drift fails the build instead of slipping in silently.

## Raising PyJWT to 2.14 (security release 2026-09-11, plan 20-01)

**What changed and how.** One line in `pyproject.toml`: `pyjwt[crypto]>=2.13,<3` became
`pyjwt[crypto]>=2.14,<3`. The lock was re-resolved with
`uv lock --upgrade-package pyjwt --upgrade-package cryptography` (never a blanket
`uv lock --upgrade`), followed by `uv sync`. Exactly three entries moved: `pyjwt` 2.13.0 to
2.14.0, `cryptography` 50.0.0 to 50.0.1, and the project's own lock entry from the stale
0.2.0 to 0.2.1. The number of package names in `uv.lock` is 60 before and after the run;
no package was added and none was removed.

**Why.** PyJWT 2.14.0 (released 2026-09-11) is a security release. Five advisories touch
the JWKS path, one sentence each:

- `GHSA-2gx3-rcp4-g85q`: an unknown `kid` in the unverified header forced a fresh JWKS
  fetch on every request, even against a fresh cache; 2.14 adds a cooldown and serializes
  concurrent refresh decisions.
- `GHSA-w6j9-cwv2-h6wq`: malformed JWK set entries let `AttributeError`/`TypeError` escape
  instead of a library error, so a broken entry could kill the whole set.
- `GHSA-8wjv-2p76-3863`: deeply nested JWS/JWK input caused unhandled recursion errors
  instead of a clean rejection.
- `GHSA-9v7f-9g4p-ffgj`: `PyJWKClient` followed redirects when fetching a JWKS, so a
  redirected target counted as a trusted key source.
- `GHSA-r6x4-923q-g947`: hardening of the HMAC key check against public key material
  passed as JWK, JWKS, array, DER or PEM.

Three of the five hit the inherited code in `src/mcp_connector/oauth/oidc.py` directly:
`GHSA-2gx3-rcp4-g85q` describes exactly the refetch behaviour of our `OidcClient._key`
(`if not fresh or kid not in self._keys.keys: await self._refresh_keys(now)`), and
`GHSA-w6j9-cwv2-h6wq` plus `GHSA-8wjv-2p76-3863` matter because `_usable_key` catches only
`jwt.PyJWTError` around `jwt.PyJWK(entry)` and `jwt.get_unverified_header(token)` is
guarded the same way, so on 2.13 a hostile token or a broken JWKS entry became an unhandled
exception at the transport boundary instead of a refusal. The other two do not hit our
code: our fetch path already refuses redirects and checks same-origin against the issuer
(`GHSA-9v7f-9g4p-ffgj` confirms that design rather than changing it), and the HMAC
hardening (`GHSA-r6x4-923q-g947`) is indirect at most because `HS*` algorithms are not in
the allowlist.

**Correction 2026-09-19 (phase 20 review, WR-01).** The paragraph above says the raise to
2.14 settles `GHSA-w6j9-cwv2-h6wq` for this code. It does not. The 2.14 corrections harden
`PyJWKClient`, not `PyJWK` against every input shape: measured against the installed
2.14.0, `jwt.PyJWK({"kty": "RSA", "n": None, "e": "AQAB", "kid": "x"})` still raises
`TypeError: Expected a string value`, and so do a numeric or list `n` and a numeric `x` on
an `OKP` entry. `TypeError` is not a `jwt.PyJWTError`, so `_usable_key` did not catch it.
The raise to 2.14 stands on its own merits (the other four advisories, and the template
`PyJWKClient` now validates); the escaping exception is closed in `oauth/jwks.py`, which
now catches `TypeError`, `ValueError` and `AttributeError` next to `jwt.PyJWTError`.
`get_unverified_header` was re-checked at the same time and needs nothing: on 2.14 it
raises `PyJWTError` for empty, non-object, deeply nested and base64-broken tokens.

**Why `jwt.PyJWKClient` is still not used, despite the fixes it received.** It is
synchronous on `urllib.request`, so in the ASGI server every fetch would block the event
loop or need a thread-pool detour. It also lacks a same-origin check against the issuer, a
size limit on the response, a key type allowlist, and the handling of a `kid` claimed by
more than one usable key. Its value for this project is the template it validates
(a cooldown after a failed refresh, serialized refresh decisions, never clearing the cache
on errors), not the code itself.

**cryptography moved in the same lock step.** The range in `pyproject.toml` stays
`>=50,<51`; 50.0.1 is a rebuilt wheel inside the already approved range, not an API
change, so the 2026-08-16 approval above continues to cover it.

**Resolved tree excerpt (`uv tree --depth 2`, 2026-09-19), pyjwt and cryptography lines
only.** The full snapshot from the original audit above is left untouched; it describes a past
state.
