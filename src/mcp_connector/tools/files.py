"""File tools: finding, browsing, reading and downloading files, and creating new ones.

Three guards protect the model's context window and the user's data (threat T-01-13):
the path guard runs before any request, the mimetype check refuses binary content instead
of shipping base64, and the size cap turns a large file into a marked slice with a
``next_offset`` instead of a multi-megabyte answer.

The binary download path has its own hard size ceiling. It returns an MCP embedded resource
instead of putting base64 into a text answer, so a capable client can save or forward the
file without feeding its bytes to the model.

The two list tools add another guard: every answer that had to stop early says so with
``truncated`` and hands out a cursor handle, so a folder with ten thousand entries costs
one page, not one context window (threat T-01-34).

``upload`` is the only write in this package, and it can only create. Everything that
could turn it into a replace is refused before the request or by Nextcloud itself.
